Firefox-2013
============

A restricted dataset of bugs in Firefox extracted from the academic release of the bugzilla dataset.  This dataset is intended for the use of software reliability researchers and has some interesting features including:
* 23 version labels (preRapid, 5, 6,... 25) for bugs from Firefox releases.
* 2,000 labeled bugs and 8,000 unlabeled bugs.

It is intended that the dataset will be released here in the coming days in both .CSV format and in .RData format with R code and a data dictionary.

The code released will include the SQL code used to extract the relevant bugs from the Bugzilla MySQL database and the R code to transform the data into the required form.

Note that the release of this work is is a work in progress!
